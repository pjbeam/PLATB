# DISCLAIMER

Under no circumstances should you follow the instructions listed below. Doing so may confound and impugn the efforts of the Texas State Legislature to turn its own citizens into secret police charged with trampling on the rights of women. As the Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave, it would be characteristically un-American to take any action against this novel, authoritarian approach of the Government of Texas. It is clear that generations of brave Americans have given their lives and their comfort to enable the Most Honorable Governor of Texas, Mr. Gregory Abbott, to divide his subjects along theological lines as in Old Europe, a place America was designed from the beginning to emulate.

We must not, as true Americans, take any action to preserve the liberty of our fellow citizens, instead it is our sacred duty to goose-step into an authoritarian abyss led by our wise and forward-thinking leaders. Therefore I have developed this bot as a means of protecting the Government of Texas against those malcontent citizens who dare value liberty, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness above 19th century theological absolutism. We have heard the law--now OBEY!

I further note that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is a powerful weapon in the hands of zealous federal prosecutors. The use of this bot outside of a sandbox may, in the eyes of some US Attornies, consitute a violation of the CFAA. In no time in history have true Americans violated the laws of the land in defense of the Republic, the rights of our fellow citizens, or to stand against the insidious, creeping tendrils of state control. As such, I feel morally jusitified in releasing this code to educate my obedient, servile American brothers and sisters as a warning against what those terrible anti-fascists might do in practice to fight the secret police and defend women using robots. This is neither legal nor financial advice.

# Reporting Issues

If in the course of your thought experiments reading this code you should intuit an issue that, in your mental environment, theoretically prevents you from submitting theoretical automated anonymous tips, please open an issue on this repository. Be as descriptive as possible regarding the errors that you face in your thoughts and dreams. We must protect the ability of the Government of Texas to rule Texan women by fear, therefore this research must be as effective as possible.
